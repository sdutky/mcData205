2015 Facility Closures,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/2015-Facility-Closures/czhi-byv9," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.

Assisted Living - Food Inspection,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Assisted-Living-Food-Inspection/ibei-xztg," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction.

County Markets/Grocery Stores,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/County-Markets-Grocery-Stores/wgri-r8fe," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

December inspections,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/December-inspections/6hig-34qq," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

Emergency Shelter Locations & Information,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Emergency-Shelter-Locations-Information/ktrx-bpgh," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

Food Inspection,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Food-Inspection/5pue-gfbe," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years.

Age adjustment methods applied to Montgomery County rates are consistent with US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) as well as Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Vital Statistics Administration (DHMH VSA).
PHS Planning and Epidemiology receives an annual data file of Montgomery County resident deaths registered with Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Vital Statistics Administration (DHMH VSA). Using SAS analytic software, MCDHHS standardizes, aggregates, and calculates age-adjusted rates for each of the leading causes of death category consistent with state and national methods and by subgroups based on age, gender, race, and ethnicity combinations. Data are released in compliance with Data Use Agreements between DHMH VSA and MCDHHS. This dataset will be updated Annually.

Leisure World Inspections,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Leisure-World-Inspections/hw6r-4h6z," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

MOCO restaurants Nov. 4,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/MOCO-restaurants-Nov-4/mrqx-w6eh," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

New Food Establishments,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/New-Food-Establishments/34wt-q4jt," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction.

Pharmacy,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Pharmacy/apmx-bw38," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction. Failure for immediate correction results in cessation of some or all food operations or closure of the facility until violation is able to be corrected.

Property Tax Credits,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Finance-Tax-Property/Property-Tax-Credits/nidv-zajy," This View contains Property Tax Credit Information. The County offers many tax credits and exemptions against the real property tax. The majority of property tax credits is determined by the Maryland State Department of Assessments and Taxation (SDAT). Specifically, SDAT determines whether a property is a “principal residence” (i.e., owner-occupied) which makes the property eligible for the County’s largest tax expenditures - homestead credit and local income tax offset credit. Moreover, the computation of many credits is performed by SDAT (e.g., homestead credit, homeowners property tax credit, senior credit), with only a minor portion of the credits computed by the Department of Finance, Treasury Division.

Rockvile Churches Food Inspections,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Health-and-Human-Services/Rockvile-Churches-Food-Inspections/gaav-4cr2," The Licensure & Regulatory Services Program inspects all licensed retail food establishments in Montgomery County for a variety of reasons (e.g. obtaining a permit, regular check-ups, or in response to complaints.) Included in this overall surveillance are two types of inspections that are conducted on a routine basis. The first type, a comprehensive inspection, is a thorough inspection that evaluates the sanitation, maintenance, and food service operations for the facility. This inspection includes many of the items found in the monitoring inspection, such as critical temperatures and food handling procedures. The second type, a monitoring inspection, involves checking the food service operation for critical food temperatures, equipment temperatures, and general food handling / cleanliness practices. While monitoring inspections are not as detailed as environmental inspections, they help ensure that the facility is operating safely throughout the year. The frequency of inspections is based on the food-borne illness risks associated with the food being processed at a facility. Based on the risk each facility is designated as high, medium, or low priority. High priority risk facilities prepare food products a day or more in advance or utilize any combination of two or more processes such as a cooking, cooling, reheating and hot holding food over four hours. Moderate priority risk facilities prepare and cook food products which are served immediately or within four hours. A low priority risk facility serve prepackage foods that are not potentially hazardous. For high risk facilities, a monitoring inspection is conducted at least twice a year, and moderate risk facilities are inspected at least once a year. High and moderate risk facilities also receive at least one comprehensive inspection every year. Low risk priority facilities typically receive one comprehensive inspection every two years. (C) Denotes a Critical Violation. A Critical Violation means a food safety requirement that requires immediate correction.

Water Quality Protection Charges,https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Environment/Water-Quality-Protection-Charges/97f6-dhn4," The Water Quality Protection Charge (WQPC) is a line item on your property tax bill.
WQPC funds many of the County's clean water initiatives including: •	Restoration of eroded stream banks
•	Upgrades to stormwater ponds
•	Storm drain cleaning and maintenance
•	Stream monitoring
•	Litter control programs
•	Stormwater facility maintenance
•	Installation of rain barrels, rain gardens and green roofs
The WQPC is calculated based on how much of your property is impervious (does not allow rain to be absorbed into the ground). As the county is developed, more area is covered in impervious concrete, asphalt, driveways, and buildings. Instead, that stormwater collects pollutants and runs off of the impervious surfaces causing damage to streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay. This is also known as stormwater pollution.
The clean water initiatives funded by the WQPC remediate the environmental damage caused by stormwater pollution. Further, the WQPC funds programs that are needed to meet the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit from the state of Maryland.
